# EKAC - One Stop Recipe Website

* To launch the website locally, clone the repository, `cd` into the `frontend`folder before running `npm run start`. 
* To access the deployed website, go to https://ekac-437bc.web.app/ This website is preliminary deployed as of 25/07/2024. 

## Vision
* Clean, homely UI that welcomes all users. Ekac focuses on ensuring that users are able to navigate through the website easily.

## Motivation 
* Centralised platform for aspiring bakers who have trouble finding recipes for their desired bakes. 
* Ekac acts as an all in one platform where users can search for recipes and also share their own recipes so that other users can also learn and utilise those recipes.
* Recipes shared are of differing difficulty levels, providing a gentle learning curve for aspiring bakers.

## About the project 
* EKAC is a 2 month long passion project, built with the intention to improve my web development skills. I had a lot of fun trying out new technology, and going through the trial and error process whilst working on this web application. Feel free to test out the website, and have a good day ahead! :)
